# Agentic_AI_Workshop

This project cross speciality mobility advisor is about

“Many doctors with nearby specialties (e.g., Pediatricians → Neonatologists) are qualified for related jobs — but no one’s showing them how to make those moves.”

So, this AI should help medical professionals:

 * Parse their CVs & certificates
 * See which roles are close to their current one
 * Show what skills they already have
 * Recommend tiny courses/certifications to jump to a new role.

# Steps to use this AI:
 * Upload some doctors or medical professional resumes and wait for the results.
 * It will give role currently in.
 * Then will give lateral roles can applly for.
 * And certificates to learn that.

Note:
 * For your convience I have given one sample Resume Pdf.
 * And I have used Gemini 1.5 Flash, Since it is freee version and rest are premium.
